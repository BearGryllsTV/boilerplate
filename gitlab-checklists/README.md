# Checklists & Issues

## Checklists

### Developer Checklist

1.  Find the relevant developer checklist (either new or redesign)
2.  Open it and view the `raw` code
3.  Copy the contents
4.  Go to Gitlab, find your account, then go to issues
5.  Click **New Issue**, then copy your content in
6.  Set the label to `Type: Checklist`
7.  Set the Assignee to yourself

### Peer Checklist

1.  Find the corresponding peer checklist and copy the `raw` contents
2.  Create a new issue in Gitlab called `Peer Checklist`
3.  Paste the raw contents in
4.  Set the label to `Type: Checklist`
5.  Set the Assignee to the relevant person (you can do this later if needs be)

## Gitlab Issues

Issues in Gitlab are a great way to track changes to a website. You can invite anyone from the business in so they can add issues too. It's a good way to work across disciplines.

- Always set a relevant label - some have been created for you by default
- Always set an Assignee
- Markdown can be used
- Invite the marketers into the relevant repos
- Marketers should be set as Reporters

## Closing issues with command line

When using issues, you can close them using the following snippet;

    git commit -m "Fix #17"

This will close the issue with the number 17.
